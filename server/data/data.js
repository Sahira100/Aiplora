    "Sure! The formula to calculate speed is:\n\nSpeed = Distance / Time\n\nWhere:\n\nSpeed = speed of the car in km/h or mph\nDistance = distance covered by the car in kilometers or miles\nTime = time taken to cover the distance in hours\n\nSo, if you know the distance traveled by the car and the time taken to cover that distance, you can use this formula to calculate the speed of the car.",
